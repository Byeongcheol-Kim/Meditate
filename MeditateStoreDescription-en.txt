Totally free application developed by vtrifonov and compiled/enhanced for newer Garmin watch models by dliedke. (if contacting me using the link this screen, I would appreciate if you provide your email so I can reply back and help).
A meditation/yoga app that tracks as an activity the heart rate, stress, respiration rate, heart rate variability (HRV), provides vibration alerts and heart rate chart.

In case you own any of the watch models below and would like a meditation session of over 20min, please use original app from vtrifonov at https://apps.garmin.com/en-US/apps/1cc98099-c08b-4fc7-91e6-0f3615a3ab2c due to memory restrictions:

Touch and hold the screen (Touch devices) or hold the left middle button (Button only devices) to edit the meditation sessions, properties and global settings.

Set Activity Name as "Location & Device Activity Name" in Garmin Connect Settings (https://connect.garmin.com/modern/settings) for activity name generated to be saved correctly.

Set custom activity name using Garmin Connect or Garmin Express, refer to guide https://support.garmin.com/en-US/?faq=SPo0TFvhQO04O36Y5TYRh5 for help.

Use "Yoga" type activity to correctly capture Respiration rate metrics due to bug in Breath work activity.

Avoid moving your wrist to better capture HRV and Respiration rate metrics.
