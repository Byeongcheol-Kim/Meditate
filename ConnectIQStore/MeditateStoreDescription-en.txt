Totally free application developed by vtrifonov and compiled/enhanced for newer Garmin watch models by dliedke.

*** Please read all guide below to avoid issues with the application in your device ***

A meditation/yoga app that tracks as an activity the heart rate, stress, respiration rate, heart rate variability (HRV), provides vibration or sound alerts, heart rate chart and respiration rate chart.

Touch and hold the screen (Touch devices) or hold the left middle button to edit the meditation sessions, properties and global settings.

Touch screen or click Start button to start meditation session. Use lap/back button to pause/resume. Use start button to end the meditation session.

Make sure to enable vibration in System - Sound and Vibe - Vibration (On).

If your device supports it and using sound notifications, make sure to enable sound in System - Sound and Vibe - Alert Tones (On).
 
Set Activity Name as "Location & Device Activity Name" in Garmin Connect Settings (https://connect.garmin.com/modern/settings) for activity name generated to be saved correctly.

Set custom activity name using watch connected to PC via USB with Garmin Express, refer to guide at https://support.garmin.com/en-US/?faq=6Vl7EbW3qA42l63ZIhJet5 for help. Do not use Garmin Connect IQ mobile because it will break application due to bugs in Garmin infrastructure.

Use "Yoga" type activity to correctly capture Respiration rate metrics due to bug in Breath work activity in some devices.

Avoid moving your wrist during the session in order to capture HRV and Respiration rate metrics. 

Note: Connect IQ API used for application development only returns the 5min average for the stress metric. That's why the numbers don't match exactly with Garmin Connect, because in GC it shows the real time stress metric when activity started and stopped.
